TransSecAI - Credit Card Fraud Detection

**TransSecAI** is an intelligent credit card fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms. The application leverages data-driven models to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, helping businesses to mitigate the risks associated with credit card fraud.

## Project Overview
TransSecAI is built to help businesses prevent fraudulent credit card transactions by providing real-time transaction predictions. The system uses a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of credit card transactions, and it predicts whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. The app uses **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use web interface and **scikit-learn** for machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data science and machine learning.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework to build the interactive user interface.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building the fraud detection model.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **joblib**: Model serialization for saving and loading the trained model.
- **StandardScaler**: Data scaling to ensure that the model receives input in the same scale as during training.

## Features
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can input transaction details and get real-time predictions (fraud or legitimate).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple Streamlit-based interface to enter transaction details.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to support additional features and more complex models.
- **Model Serialization**: The trained model is saved and loaded using joblib for easy use.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TransSecAI.git
cd TransSecAI
2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have pip installed, then run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application:
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start a local server, and you can open the app in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Enter the transaction details such as the transaction amount, time, and other features (V1 to V30).
Click the Predict button to get a real-time prediction of whether the transaction is Fraudulent or Legitimate.
How It Works
Data Collection: The model was trained using a dataset containing features related to credit card transactions (e.g., amount, time, and anonymized features).

Model Training: The machine learning model is trained using a RandomForestClassifier or any other suitable classifier. It learns patterns in transaction data to identify fraudulent activities.

Prediction: When a user inputs a transactionâ€™s details, the model scales the input data, processes it, and predicts whether the transaction is fraudulent.

Fraud Detection: The system displays the prediction to the user, indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Model Training
If you want to train the model yourself, you can use the provided training scripts and dataset. Follow these steps to train and serialize the model:

Prepare the Dataset: Make sure your dataset includes features such as Amount, Time, V1 to V30 (or as per your dataset).

Train the Model: Use a machine learning algorithm like Random Forest or Logistic Regression to train the model. For example:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import joblib

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('credit_card_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = data.drop(columns=['fraudulent'])  # Features
y = data['fraudulent']  # Labels

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Save the model and scaler
joblib.dump(model, 'fraud_detection_model.pkl')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.pkl')
Test and Evaluate: Use the model to evaluate the performance on the test set and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

Serialize the Model: Once the model is trained, save it using joblib so you can load it in the Streamlit app.

### How to Customize the README:
1. **Repository Links**: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/TransSecAI.git` with the actual GitHub URL of your repository.
2. **Model Training Instructions**: You may want to further customize the **Model Training** section to fit your model's details.
3. **Requirements File**: The instructions assume you have a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary Python libraries (`streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, etc.).
4. **Personalize**: Feel free to add more sections as needed, like "Project Demo," "Screenshots," etc.
